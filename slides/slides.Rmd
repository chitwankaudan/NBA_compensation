## Introduction

- In this analysis, our goal is to answer the question: **In the 2015-2016 season, how do the skills of a player relate to his salary?**
- We will be investigating this question by scraping and cleaning data on player performance, then computing a weighted statistic as a proxy for each player's overall performance. This statistic will then be compared with each player's salary. 

## Data

- Our data was taken from basketball-reference.com, which provides data on player rosters, performance, statistics, and salaries.
- Although unaffiliated with the NBA, Basketball Reference is a trusted platform for players' performance statistics, salaries, rosters, and other such information, and it is referenced and highly praised by ESPN and former players alike.

## Conclusion

- The main finding of our analysis is that during the 2015-2016 season, a player's EFF* was weakly correlated with their salary.
- In future analyses, it may be helpful to adjust the formula used in the adjusted EFF metric in order to further reduce the bias towards offensive players.
